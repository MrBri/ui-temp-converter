# Celisus to Fahrenheit and vice versa

Exercise in using Rust with Slint to create a native desktop GUI that convertes both Celisus to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celisus when inputing a number.

Didn't want just create another cli app and Slint is the only 1.0 native UI system I've found. Was initially turned off by learning another "language" i.e DSL but as I got used to the concepts and reading the docs, it's pretty straight forward coming from a JavaScript/HTML/CSS background.

Playing aroudn in the Editor helped to get used to how things work with the Slint DSL: https://slint.dev/releases/1.4.1/editor

Started with the template https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template#slint-rust-template
